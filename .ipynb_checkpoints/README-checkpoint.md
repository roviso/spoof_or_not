# [Presentation Attack Detection](https://github.com/ee09115/spoofing_detection)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the image-based Presentation Attack Detection - PAD -  systems in two different domains: (i) cork and (ii) face PAD. The proposed PAD system relies on the combination of two different color spaces and uses only a single frame to distinguish from a bona fide image and an image attack, see Fig. 1.

    abstract="Using 2D images in authentication systems raises the question of spoof attacks: is it possible to deceive an authentication system using fake models possessing identical visual properties of the genuine one? In this work, an anti-spoofing method approach for a wine anti-counterfeiting system is presented. The proposed method relies in two different color spaces: CIE L*u*v* and {\$}{\$}YC{\_}rC{\_}b{\$}{\$}, to distinguish between a genuine instance and a spoof attack. To evaluate the proposed strategy, two databases were used: a private database, with photos/2D attacks of cork stoppers, created for this work; and the public Replay-Attack database that is used for face spoofing detection methods testing. The results on the private database show that the anti-spoofing approach is able to distinguish with high accuracy a real photo from an attack. Regarding the public database, the results were obtained with existing methods, as the best HTER results using a single frame approach.",
